    "The object of the game is to find all the words that are 4 letters or longer that can be made using the letters in the hexagons.  The words you find **can** use letters multiple times and **must** include the middle letter.\n",

    "    HUNT, CHUTE, THEY\n",

    "    CUTE (does not include the middle letter 'H')\n",
    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "    * 0 points for word length < 4\n",
    "    * 1 point for words of length 4\n",

    "    * HUT = 0 points\n",
    "    * HUSTLE = 0 points (no S or L in the puzzle)\n",

    "    * CHUTE = 5 points\n",
    "    * CHUTNEY = 7 + 7 (bonus for all letters used) = 14 points"
